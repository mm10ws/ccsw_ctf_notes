I opened up the pcap in wireshark.

There were a few thing I noticed right away:
1. Sequence of ack and push tcp packets.
2. One tcp packet was larger than the rest at 16980 bytes.
3. Looking at the data of the large packet showed strings that indicated that it might be an executable.
4. Some packet data had readable text that was prefixed by a single letter (S, P, F). I didn't know what this meant that this point, but I guessed that it was some sort of control code.

I filtered the packets to only show the ones with data to make it easier to read (filter: tcp.flags.push == 1)

I exported the data section of the large packet as a bin and ran the file command on it, but it did not indicate it was an executable. I tried opening it in Ghidra, but Ghidra was not able to make sense of it. So I thought it might be incomplete at this point.

I looked at some of the other packets with data and found one with the text "elf" in it, so I knew there was an executable being transferred and that it was being transferred in chunks. I used "follow tcp stream" in wireshark to export all the data bytes as a single binary. I made sure to strip off the parts of the stream that did not look like they were part of the elf file. Now I ran the file command on the binary and it showed the following:
extracted.bin: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=af843cf7cf8bc40881b88c51a87d85db2c51006d, with debug_info, not stripped

I ran strings on it and found some interesting strings:
AES_encrypt
AES_set_encrypt_key
socket
htons
fopen
connect
recv
KEY: %s
FILE: %s
/home/jeff/Desktop/ctf_pcap_forensic_analysis/chal2

Based on the strings it looks like this executable is doing some encryption, reading a file, and sending/receiving data from a socket.

I opened the bin in ghidra and navigated to the entry point. I was able to determine what was happening at this point. I have included the decompilation below with my comments inserted to explain each step:

int main(void)
{
  long lVar1;
  int iVar2;
  FILE *__stream;
  size_t sVar3;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  int i;
  int sock;
  int ret;
  FILE *fp;
  sockaddr_in addr;
  AES_KEY aesKey;
  char key [16];
  char block [16];
  char cypher [16];
  char buff [128];
  char file_name [128];
  
  lVar1 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);

  memset(key,0,0x20);
  memset(file_name,0,0x80);

  // Default filename (f_dnes/.gal), maybe a copy of this executable
  file_name._0_8_ = 0x665f646e65732f2e;
  file_name._8_4_ = 0x67616c;

  // Create a socket
  sock = socket(2,1,0);
  if (-1 < sock) {
    // Set the socket to localhost port 1234 and connect
    addr.sin_family = 2;
    addr.sin_addr = 0;
    addr.sin_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
    addr.sin_port = htons(0x4d2);
    iVar2 = connect(sock,(sockaddr *)&addr,0x10);
    if (iVar2 != -1) {
      do {
        // Receive loop
        while( true ) {
          memset(buff,0,0x80);

          // Receive data from the socket and put it in buff
          recv(sock,buff,0x80,0);

          // If the first received byte is 'S' break out of this loop
          if (buff[0] == 'S') break;

          // If the first received byte is 'P' store the next 16 bytes as the key 
          if (buff[0] == 'P') {
            key._0_8_ = buff._1_8_;
            key._8_8_ = buff._9_8_;
            printf("KEY: %s\n",key);

            // Init our key, this is a function from openssl
            AES_set_encrypt_key((uchar *)key,0x80,(AES_KEY *)&aesKey);
          }

          // If the first received byte is 'F' store the next 128 bytes as the file_name 
          else if (buff[0] == 'F') {
            sVar3 = strlen(buff);
            cypher[sVar3 + 0xf] = '\0';
            strncpy(file_name,buff + 1,0x80);
            printf("FILE: %s\n",file_name);
          }
        }

        // At this point we have broken out of the loop, which means we just received data staring with 'S'

        // If we have a valid key at this point, init the AES key
        if (key[0] != '\0') {
          AES_set_encrypt_key((uchar *)key,0x80,(AES_KEY *)&aesKey);
        }

        // Open/read the file_name we got or the default value if we didn't get anything
        __stream = fopen(file_name,"r");
        while (sVar3 = fread(block,1,0x10,__stream), sVar3 != 0) {
          if (key[0] == '\0') {
            // If our key value is not valid, just send the file content we read.
            // Probably corresponding to the binary that was sent since it was not encrypted.
            send(sock,block,0x10,0);
          }
          else {
            // Otherwise, scramble the file bytes
            for (i = 0; i < 0xf; i = i + 1) {
              block[i + 1] = block[i + 1] ^ block[i];
            }

            // Then encrypt the file bytes
            AES_encrypt((uchar *)block,(uchar *)cypher,(AES_KEY *)&aesKey);
            
            // And finally send
            send(sock,cypher,0x10,0);
          }
          memset(block,0,0x10);
          memset(cypher,0,0x10);
        }
        fclose(__stream);
      } while( true );
    }
  }
  if (lVar1 == *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
    return -1;
  }
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  __stack_chk_fail();
}

So based on the code above, here is what I learned:
1. The first byte letters S, P, F are control codes.
2. 'S' means to break out of the receive loop and send the contents of a file. Either the default file (f_dnes/.gal) or a filename given by a previously received packet starting with the 'F' control code.
3. 'F' means to take the following bytes as a filename that will be read and sent on the next 'S' control code received.
4. 'P' means to take the following bytes as an encryption key.
5. Encryption is done using AES_set_encrypt_key and AES_encrypt which means openssl is being used and it is AES ECB mode.
6. The file bytes are scrambled with successive xor before being encrypted, so we will need to do the reverse process.

Going back to the final few packets in the stream, I saw that a file (F code) named flag.txt is being requested. Also I saw an encryption password (P code) being sent: Prestidigitation. The next two packets received have what looks like encrypted bytes in 16 byte blocks (padded). So the goal is to decrypt them with what we have learned. I made a quick python script to do this:

from Crypto.Cipher import AES

def unscramble(byte_string):
    result = bytearray(byte_string)

    # Do the reverse of what the binary did: bytes[i+1] = bytes[i+1] ^ bytes[i])
    for i in reversed(range(1,16)):
        result[i] = result[i] ^ result[i - 1]
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Taken from pcap
    key = b"Prestidigitation"
    payload_bytes1 = bytes.fromhex("e1dbfd6826a14f279fafe76982333070")
    payload_bytes2 = bytes.fromhex("a0595e10eec5ffd64cf3569eac102451")

    # Init cypher as ECB mode to match what openssl will use for AES_encrypt
    decipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)

    # Decrypt using key
    msg1 = decipher.decrypt(payload_bytes1)
    msg2 = decipher.decrypt(payload_bytes2)

    # Print what we got so far, should still be scrambled at this point
    print(msg1 + msg2)

    # Unscramble both messages
    result1 = unscramble(bytearray(msg1))
    result2 = unscramble(bytearray(msg2))
    
    # At this point we should have the decrypted and decoded messages
    print(result1 + result2)

The output of this script gives the decrypted flag:
bytearray(b'flag{CATS_CATS_ARE_NICE}\n\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00')
